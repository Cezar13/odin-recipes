    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cheesecake</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>cracker crumble</ul>
    <ul>sugar</ul>
    <ul>butter</ul>
    <ul>cream</ul>
    <ul>eggs</ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <li>Select a pie pan whose inside top dimension is at least 9", and whose height is at least 1 1/4". Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.</li>
    <li>To make the crust: Stir together all of the crust ingredients, mixing until thoroughly combined.</li>
    <li>Press the crumbs into the bottom and up the sides of the pie pan, making a thicker layer on the bottom than on the sides.</li>
    <li>To make the filling: Mix together the room-temperature cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Mix in the eggs and vanilla, again mixing until smooth. To avoid beating too much air into the batter, use a mixer set at low-medium speed. To avoid lumps, make sure the cream cheese is softened, and/or at room temperature.</li>
